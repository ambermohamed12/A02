To use VS code you would download it from the official website. 
Moreover, open a file and create a new code you would go file>open folder, and then chose which type of file such as html, .js, .py you want to use.
In that way, you can stall extentsions to VS code to run different program languages using Crtl+Shift+X and run Python, C, C++, etc.
To run code you would go to the Terminal. 
When it comes to Github, you can install Git/Github into VS Code, you would open the Source Control panel. However, you would also have to your repository finalized prior before. 
You would edit your files as needed, and then hit + button to stage any changes/commit them. 
Then you would connect/push your repository to Github by adding the respository URL to the terminal. Or you can also import the VS code written from there into Github (either or).
* **Branch** : A branch is a separate version of your project. It allows you to work on changes without affecting the main code.
* **Clone** : Cloning is making a copy of a project from a remote repository (like GitHub) to your computer.
* **Commit**: A commit is a saved version of your project with specific changes. It's like a snapshot of your work.
* **Fetch**: Fetching gets the latest changes from the remote repository but doesn’t apply them to your local code yet.
* **GIT**: Git is a tool for tracking changes in your code. It helps you manage different versions of a project.
* **Github**: GitHub is a website where you can store and share your Git projects online and collaborate with others.
* **Merge** : Merging combines changes from one branch into another, typically putting new work into the main project.
* **Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict happens when Git can’t combine changes automatically because two people edited the same part of the code differently.
* **Push**: Pushing sends your changes from your computer to a remote repository like GitHub.
* **Pull**: Pulling gets the latest changes from the remote repository and applies them to your local code.
* **Remote**: A remote is a version of your project stored online (like on GitHub) that you can push or pull changes to/from.
* **Repository**: A repository is a storage space for your project, where all your files and their version history are kept.
